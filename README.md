# Vector Databases

This repository contains comprehensive study materials, practical implementations, and hands-on projects for understanding and working with vector databases, with a focus on Weaviate as the primary vector database platform.

## Overview

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store, index, and query high-dimensional vector data efficiently. They are essential for modern AI applications including semantic search, recommendation systems, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, and similarity matching.

This repository provides:
- **Practical implementations** of vector database setups
- **Interactive notebooks** for learning and experimentation
- **Real-world datasets** for testing and development
- **Comprehensive documentation** and guides

## Repository Structure

### Notebooks
Interactive Jupyter notebooks for learning and experimentation:
- [`notebooks/Vector-Database.ipynb`](./notebooks/Vector-Database.ipynb) - Comprehensive vector database tutorial and concepts
- [`notebooks/vdb-indexing.001.lsh.ipynb`](./notebooks/vdb-indexing.001.lsh.ipynb) - Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) indexing techniques

### Datasets
Sample datasets for testing and development:
- [`datasets/data.joblib`](./datasets/data.joblib) - Serialized dataset for quick loading
- [`datasets/jeopardy_tiny.json`](./datasets/jeopardy_tiny.json) - Small Jeopardy dataset for testing
- [`datasets/recipes/`](./datasets/recipes/) - Recipe-related datasets and examples

### Weaviate Implementation
Complete Weaviate setup with development environment:
- [`weaviate/`](./weaviate/) - Weaviate database implementation and tooling
  - Local development environment with Docker
  - Configuration and deployment scripts

## Quick Start

1. **Explore the concepts**: Start with the [`notebooks/Vector-Database.ipynb`](./notebooks/Vector-Database.ipynb) to understand vector database fundamentals

2. **Set up Weaviate**: Navigate to [`weaviate/local-dev/`](./weaviate/local-dev/) for a complete local development environment

3. **Experiment with datasets**: Use the provided datasets in [`datasets/`](./datasets/) for testing and learning

## Learning Path

1. **Foundation**: Review vector database concepts in the notebooks
2. **Setup**: Install and configure Weaviate using the local development setup
3. **Practice**: Upload and query datasets using the provided tools
4. **Advanced**: Implement custom solutions using the examples as templates

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Jupyter Notebook environment
- Required Python packages (see individual directories for specific requirements)
