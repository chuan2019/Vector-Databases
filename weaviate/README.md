# Weaviate Implementation

This directory contains a complete Weaviate vector database implementation with local development environment, GUI applications, and comprehensive tooling for vector database operations.

## 🎯 Overview

Weaviate is an open-source vector database that stores both objects and vectors, allowing for combining vector search with structured filtering. This implementation provides:

- **Local development environment** with Docker containerization
- **GUI applications** for database visualization and management
- **Automated setup scripts** and configuration management
- **Dataset upload tools** and sample data
- **Comprehensive documentation** and usage guides

- **Quick start**: Single-node and cluster deployments
- **Docker configurations**: Pre-configured compose files
- **Development tools**: Makefile automation and scripts
- **Documentation**: Setup guides and configuration overviews
- **Dataset management**: Upload tools and sample datasets

### 🖥️ GUI Applications
[`gui/`](./gui/) - Visual database management tools

#### WeaviateDBCluster
[`gui/WeaviateDBCluster/`](./gui/WeaviateDBCluster/) - Streamlit-based cluster management interface
- Database cluster monitoring and management
- Visual query interface and data exploration
- Real-time cluster health and performance metrics

#### Wvsee
[`gui/wvsee/`](./gui/wvsee/) - Weaviate visualization and exploration tool
- Interactive data exploration interface
- Schema visualization and management
- Query builder and results visualization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Local Development Setup
Navigate to the local development environment:
```bash
cd local-dev/
make setup    # First-time setup
make up       # Start single-node instance
# or
make up-cluster  # Start 3-node cluster
```

### 2. GUI Applications
Start the cluster management interface:
```bash
cd gui/WeaviateDBCluster/
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### 3. Upload Sample Data
```bash
cd local-dev/
make upload-sample  # Upload provided sample dataset
```
