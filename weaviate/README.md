# Weaviate Implementation

This directory contains a complete Weaviate vector database implementation with local development environment, GUI applications, and comprehensive tooling for vector database operations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Weaviate is an open-source vector database that stores both objects and vectors, allowing for combining vector search with structured filtering. This implementation provides:

- **Local development environment** with Docker containerization
- **GUI applications** for database visualization and management
- **Automated setup scripts** and configuration management
- **Dataset upload tools** and sample data
- **Comprehensive documentation** and usage guides

## Directory Structure

### Local Development Environment
[`local-dev/`](./local-dev/) - Complete local Weaviate setup
- **Quick start**: Single-node and cluster deployments
- **Docker configurations**: Pre-configured compose files
- **Development tools**: Makefile automation and scripts
- **Documentation**: Setup guides and configuration overviews
- **Dataset management**: Upload tools and sample datasets

## Quick Start

### 1. Local Development Setup
Navigate to the local development environment:
```bash
cd local-dev/
make setup    # First-time setup
make up       # Start single-node instance
# or
make up-cluster  # Start 3-node cluster
```

### 2. GUI Applications
Start the cluster management interface:
```bash
cd gui/WeaviateDBCluster/
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### 3. Upload Sample Data
```bash
cd local-dev/
make upload-sample  # Upload provided sample dataset
```

## Documentation

### Local Development

- [`local-dev/docs/CONFIG_OVERVIEW.md`](./local-dev/docs/CONFIG_OVERVIEW.md) - Configuration details and file structure
- [`local-dev/docs/DATASET_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`](./local-dev/docs/DATASET_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md) - Dataset upload and management

## Features

### Local Development Environment
- **Single-node and cluster modes** - Flexible deployment options
- **Docker containerization** - Isolated and reproducible environments
- **Automated setup** - One-command installation and configuration
- **Dataset upload tools** - Easy data ingestion and management
- **Development utilities** - Debugging and monitoring tools

## Requirements

### Core Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Make (for automation scripts)

## Use Cases

### Development and Testing
- **Local development**: Test vector search applications locally
- **Data experimentation**: Try different embedding models and configurations
- **Performance testing**: Benchmark queries and ingestion speeds

### Learning and Education
- **Vector database concepts**: Hands-on experience with real implementations
- **Production preparation**: Learn deployment and management practices

### Production Preparation
- **Configuration testing**: Validate settings before production deployment
- **Data migration**: Test data upload and schema changes
- **Monitoring setup**: Establish operational procedures and monitoring
